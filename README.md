# RoarGraph: A Projected Bipartite Graph for Efficient Cross-Modal Approximate Nearest Neighbor Search | MysteryANN

The codes for the NIPS 2023 challenge are available in separate branches. The main branch is the codebase of the RoarGraph paper. It also üèÜ Winning NeurIPS' Competition Track: Big ANN, Practical Vector Search Challenge. (OOD Track) (Our other solution won the Sparse Track).

You can find the codes for the NIPS 2023 competition in other branches, **NOT** the main branch, even if they have similar designs from the same research project.

I also prepared a tidy code repository for the VLDB paper. Please refer to https://github.com/matchyc/RoarGraph for detailed instructions, and avoid using the main branch to reproduce paper, you may face issues.

This code builds upon the NSG repo and incorporates other open-source implementations.
