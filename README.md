# RoarGraph | MysteryANN: Efficient Cross-modal Approximate Nearest Neighbor Search (Vector Search)

üèÜ Winning NeurIPS' Competition Track: Big ANN, Practical Vector Search Challenge. (OOD Track)

The fastest open-source cross-modal vector search solution.


MysteryANN is a cutting-edge research project centered around cross-modal retrieval. It has been specifically designed for cross-modal Approximate Nearest Neighbor Search (ANNS) while maintaining robustness for single-modal vector search. This repository builds upon the NSG repo and incorporates other open-source implementations. We have added our custom index codes extensively, resulting in significant speed improvements and state-of-the-art performance.

**Please Note:** 
- This codebase is only intended for use in the [NIPS 2023 Big-ANN Competition](https://big-ann-benchmarks.com/neurips23.html).
<!-- It also serves as the codebase for our **upcoming research paper**. Therefore, the code in this repository may undergo changes and enhancements as we refine our approach.-->
 **Our research paper is submitted**, so we kindly say that **this repository or idea does not support academic purposes temporarily**. We appreciate your understanding.
 I plan to provide a tidy library in the near future.

**Repository Organization:**
- The codes for the NIPS 2023 challenge are available in separate branches.
- As we are currently focused on our paper, the codebase might not be as tidy as we'd like. Rest assured, we plan to clean up the code in the near future.

**About the Name:**
- The name "MysteryANN" is temporary and may not be the final name for this project; it's just for fun and represents "unknown."
- RoarGraph will be the suitable name.
